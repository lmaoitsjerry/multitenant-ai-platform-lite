**Completed:** 2026-01-16

## Summary

Fixed performance issues and data accuracy bugs across the tenant dashboard and admin platform. Resolved FAISS helpdesk integration issues.

## Phases Completed

| Phase | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Tenant Dashboard Performance | ✓ Complete |
| 2 | Invoice Revenue Fix | ✓ Complete |
| 3 | Admin Platform Performance | ✓ Complete |

## Key Accomplishments

### Pre-GSD Work (Issues 1 & 4)

- **Admin Knowledge Base Stats**: Added FAISS index stats to admin (98,086 vectors displayed)

### Phase 1: Tenant Dashboard Performance
- Removed blocking spinner from Layout component
- Implemented stale-while-revalidate caching for clientInfo
- Dashboard renders instantly on cached visits

### Phase 2: Invoice Revenue Fix

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Make helpdesk endpoints public | Prevents 401 errors with expired JWT | ✓ Good |
| Use optional auth for helpdesk | Allows both authenticated and anonymous queries | ✓ Good |
| Add FAISS stats to admin | Provides visibility into vector index health | ✓ Good |
| Focus on caching for performance | Simpler than restructuring API calls | ✓ Good |

## Known Issues Carried Forward

- FAISS loads 98K vectors on startup (~100 seconds cold start)
- Sentence-transformers model is ~400MB
- Helpdesk returns robotic responses (to be addressed in v2.0)
